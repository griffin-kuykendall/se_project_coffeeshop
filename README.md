## Plan on improving the project

Future Improvements

This project is a work in progress, and I have several ideas for future improvements. Two key additions I'd like to make are:

- **Expanded Content:** I plan to add more in-depth information about the coffee shop, such as its history, the unique brewing methods used, and perhaps even some staff spotlights. This will enrich the user experience and provide a more comprehensive view of the shop.
- **Search Functionality:** To improve navigation, especially as the site grows, I intend to implement a search bar at the top of the page. This will allow users to quickly find specific information or products.
- **Merchandise/Coffee Sales Page:** I plan to add a dedicated page to showcase and sell coffee beans and merchandise related to the coffee shop.
